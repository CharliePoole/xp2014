<p>May 25th with embedded and safety critical agile tutorials by Nancy van Schooenderwoert and James Grenning, author of "Test Driven Development for Embedded C"</p>

<h3>Agile by Design</h3>
<p>The theme of the conference is Agile by Design. Successful agile adoption comes from a holistic perspective that involves the whole team and sometimes the whole organization. Come learn what has worked for practitioners and come hear some of the latest thinking in areas such as project chartering, coaching teams, risk management, test driven development, working with legacy code, organizational change and many more topics. This conference brings together many international experts in agile development and provides access to those experts through sessions and interactive workshops.</p>

<h3>Some Design Notes on XP2012</h3>
<p>The agile (r)evolution started in the late 1990s, some say the international kick-off was indeed the very first XP2000 conference in Sardinia late in June 2000.</p>

<p>Key was that stakeholders and developers met every 1-2 weeks and planned the next steps together as a team with post-its or index cards.
Every day the team and some stakeholders had a short stand-up meeting in front of this jointly created plan.</p>

<p>Nowadays it is common that software planning tool vendors sponsor agile conferences, but XP2012 has selected an unusual official tools sponsor: OfficeDepot who brings XP2012 an abundance of the most effective visual planning tools, post-its, whiteboards, sticky walls, by the pallet.</p>

<h3>XP2012 Team Challenge</h3>
<p>Agile teams onsite at XP2012 will build plan and software for jet fighters, rugged life-critical android applications, and a website that holds Ebay at bay in 20+ markets worldwide.</p>

<p>Each team's challenge is to go from plan to production-ready within the week.</p>
<p>We are grateful that SAAB Group,  Sweden's third  largest software development organization,  and Schibstedt's Blocket.se,  Swedens household name in online advertising,  support and participate in the XP2012 Team Challenge.</p>

<h3>XP2012 Executive and Change Agents Exchange</h3>
<p>The Xp2012 Industrial Reference Group organize a vendor-free exchange for agile decision makers and change agents in the  many different "agile end-user"  industries that depend on truly successful software development.</p>

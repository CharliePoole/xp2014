Many issues and problems still remain unexplored in these two highly-related fields incorporating topics such as the theoretical underpinnings of refactoring, TDD, empirical studies, refactoring of test artefacts, code smell analysis and patterns (both design and micro) to name just a few. Refactoring also has a growing importance in the monitoring of system's evolution and the propensity of systems to minimise maintenance effort and fault propensity; the over-riding question, still largely unanswered, is whether we can quantify the benefits of refactoring. The purpose and goal of the REFTEST Workshop is to bring together industrial practitioners and academics in a setting where current issues in refactoring and test crossover can be presented, relationships with testing discussed, results from current research in refactoring/testing disseminated and future directions distilled.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>      <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Coaching Agile Teams</h2>   <h3>Coaching Agile Teams J.B.

Markus Gärtner (Workshop, 3 hours)</h3>   <p>Over the past decades we developed a very broad picture of the testing profession. In the past decade this picture has been shaken by the emergence of Agile software development processes.</p><p>On the first German Agile Testing and Exploratory Testing Workshop (GATE) in October 2011 the participants started with a definition of what Agile Testing could be. One of the biggest insights was that the practices that help a tester on an Agile team also work well for a more traditional tester.</p><p>In this workshop the participants will work out their own definition of Agile Testing. By this discussion we will explore the differences between testing on an Agile project compared to a more traditional project. The participants will leave the workshop afterwards with at least three skills that help a tester on Agile as well as on a traditional project.</p>  <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>      <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Agile Cafe</h2>   <h3>Come to the Agile Cafe!</h3>   <p>Waiting for a workshop or tutorial to begin?

Our goal is to move beyond agile teams to foster an agile organization. The transition to "agile" may be initiated within legacy-driven organizations by grassroots teams trialing agile approaches and evolve to sanctioned pilot projects. In some cases the adoption of agile may be accelerated by the acquisition of an agile company. Cultural shock and reformation may ensue when agile teams begin integration with the behemoth that is represented by the legacy-driven organization. Through a mixture of challenges and successes best practices can evolve.

Agile product or project development, especially within large corporation are facing here specific challenges provided by the larger framework. The common departmental structure is often experienced more like a burden than support. As well the organization's structure (yes, and of course as well its culture) can be experiences as being more or less helpful. Yet still, in order to become successful the agile undertaking has to deal with these challenges.</p><p>In this session, I want to explore how departments like Human Resources, Legal, Marketing, Sales, yet as well Quality Control, or Operations can support and how can they hinder agility. Despite the challenges, the focus is on leveraging the departments in order to become successful.

Moreno, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain</h3>  <h3>Agile Principles as Software Engineering Principles: An analysis Normand Séguin, Guy Tremblay and Houda Bagane (Research Paper, 30 minutes)</h3><p>Ever since software engineering was born, over 40 years ago, hundreds of "fundamental principles" for software engineering have been proposed. It is hard to believe that such a young discipline—in fact, any discipline—would rest on such a large number of "fundamental" principles. A few years ago, Séguin and Abran indeed showed, through a detailed analysis of the various principles proposed in the software engineering literature during the 1970–2003 period, that many—in fact most!—of the statements proposed as "fundamental principles" could not be considered as software engineering principles. The analysis method proposed by Séguin and Abran provides, among other things, a rigorous definition of term principle along with a set of criteria allowing to verify whether or not a statement is a software engineering principle. In this paper, we apply this method to the agile principles. More specifically, we examine the principles proposed by the Agile Manifesto as well as those from three well-known agile methods: XP, Scrum, and DSDM. Our analysis results show that many of the statements proposed as agile principles are in fact also software engineering principles.</p><h3>Agile Software Development Practice Adoption Survey Narendra Kurapati, Venkata Sarath Chandra Manyam and Kai Petersen (Research Paper, 30 minutes)</h3><p>Agile methodologies are often not used "out of the box" by practitioners, instead they select the practices that fit their needs best. However, little is known which agile practices the practitioners choose. This study investigates agile practice adoption by asking practitioners which practices they are using on project and organizational level. We investigated how commonly used individual agile practices are, combinations of practices and their frequency of usage, as well as the degree of compliance to agile methodologies (Scrum and XP), and as how successful practitioners perceive the adoption. The research method used is survey. The survey has been sent to over 600 respondents, and has been posted on LinkedIn, Yahoo, and Google groups. In total 109 answers have been received. Practitioners can use the knowledge of the commonality of individual practices and combinations of practices as support in focusing future research efforts, and as decision support in selecting agile practices.</p><h3>Applying Agile Development in Mass-Produced Embedded Systems Ulrik Eklund and Jan Bosch (Research Paper, 30 minutes)</h3><p>The paper presents a method to manage critical interactions to manage when introducing agile software development in mass-produced embedded systems. The method consists of a context model together with a set of measures, and is validated by empirical evidence from three cases. From an industrial perspective, the paper provides a prescription on how to implement agile software development outside the typical domains for agile, in this case for mass-produced products with embedded software governed by a stage-gate process for mechanics and hardware. From a research perspective, the paper provides an analysis of the software development cycle for products with embedded software, especially where product development as a whole is driven by a plan-driven process. The main contribution is a method for introducing agile in areas where by necessity the full R&amp;D process cannot be agile.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>      <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Tech Demos</h2>   <h3>Design for Testability is a Fraud TDD is easy Lior Friedman (Demo, 30 minutes)</h3>   <p>Old habits are hard to change. This also stands true when adopting TDD practices. One of the main reasons for TDD relatively slowpenetration is the so called need to first make the production codes fit specific design patterns, or in other words design the code for testability.However, in today's world of testing tools, there is no true need for these changes to occur. Isolation frameworks have grown beyond the needto refit the code to their needs and are able to isolate any part of any given design. A major part of the community is advocating that these kinds of design changes are beneficial, while this may hold true, it is not relevant to any real testability issues. If these design patterns makes a better design, please take it up with the design "department". Don't make a testing issue out of it. Presenting redesign as a prerequisite for TDD, add another significant barrier for most companies out there. This talk will demonstrate how one barrier on your way to happy TDDing can be removed using the proper tooling, and prove once and for all that Design for Testability is not much more than a fraud.</p>      <h3>Agile Modelling Giorgio Natili (Demo, 30 minutes)</h3>   <p>Agile models are more effective than traditional models because they key is that they don't have to be complete but just good enough to move on. In traditional software development the modeling phase is time consuming and implies formalisms like UML that represent one of the anti-agile patterns. A key point of agile modeling is to create a model with pairs and when possible to create more than one model in parallel; a model has to be understandable as much as possible from all the stakeholders involved in the project.</p><p>A simple and direct communication is the key to make the modeling phase understandable for the end customer and valuable for the team. During this session you will learn how to address this goal and, even more important, you will see how create a model open to changes and able to evolve duringthe software development cycle.</p><p>In order to address these points you don't need a specific tool but there are several tools that can help like index cards, crc cards, post it, shared dashboard, pseudocode tools, etc. The open source market offers several tools to help to discuss models also without sitting in the same room, between these we'll take a look to crcpro, agilo, envision-apdt, icescrum, etc.</p>         <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>              <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Open Space</h2>      <p>See the Market Place for current sessions.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>            <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Tribal Leadership</h2>      <h3>Tribal Leadership: Create the Place Where You Long to Belong Portia Tung (Workshop, 90 minutes)</h3>   <p>Do you hope that one day all the office politics will be replaced by a common and worthwhile cause?

Working for critical bank and insurance projects, supporting airport infrastructures, security governmental processes, the mainframes are the core back-bone part of the infrastructure of many Fortune 500 companies. Such constellation itself brings unique challenges and not only the technical ones. Can you for example imagine bringing such customer into the team, letting them interfere with the final product? And that's not the only challenge. You are facing tuns of old legacy code, working with huge amount of data which comes with testing challenges along. Last but not least,there is only a limited set of tools at hand.</p><p>Mainframe development has never been easy, universities do not teach about mainframe as a platform and using languages such as assembler and COBOL aligned with a year long release cycles do not support agility out of the box. We would argue though that such conservative environment is an idealplace to implement agile practices and achieve an immediate impact on the quality, productivity, and flexibility. In addition, nowadays the mainframecompanies are facing a challenge of exchanging generations of developers so new processes and techniques are being introduced to this stringent environment just on time.</p><h3>TBA (Experience Report, 30 minutes)</h3><p>ABSTRACT</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>      <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Agile Teams</h2>     <h3>Session Chair: Agustín Yagüe, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain</h3><h3>Understanding Team Dynamics in Distributed Agile Software Development Siva Dorairaj, James Noble and Petra Malik (Research Paper, 30 minutes)</h3><p>Team dynamics are patterns of interaction among team members that determine the performance of the team. Success of Agile software development depends on team interaction. Team interactions are, however, affected in distributed teams. Through a Grounded Theory study that involved 40 Agile practitioners from 24 different software companies in the USA, India, and Australia, we investigate the key concerns of distributed Agile teams. We found Agile teams depend significantly on team interaction, and adopt six strategies that promote effective team interaction in distributed software development.</p><h3>Information Flow within a Dispersed Agile Team: A Distributed Cognition Perspective Helen Sharp, Rosalba Giuffrida and Grigori Melnik (Research Paper, 30 minutes)</h3><p>One of the hallmarks of a co-located agile team is the simple and open flow of information between its members. In a co-located setting, peripheral awareness, osmotic communication and simple information radiators support agile principles such as collective ownership, minimal documentation and simple design, and facilitate smooth collaboration. However in a dispersed agile team, where individual team members are distributed across several sites, these mechanisms are not available and information sharing has to be more explicit. Research into distributed software development has been tackling similar issues, but little work has been reported into dispersed agile teams. This paper reports on a field study of one successful partially dispersed agile team. Using a distributed cognition analysis which focuses on information propagation and transformation within the team we investigate how the team collaborates and compare our findings with those from co-located teams.</p><h3>Sensing High-Performing Software Teams: Proposal of an Instrument for Self-Monitoring Petri Kettunen and Simo Moilanen (Research Paper, 30 minutes)</h3><p>Agile/Lean software development teams are by definition striving for high performance. However, it is not straightforward to recognize and cultivate those high-performing teams. Sometimes the team members perceive their internal performance differently than their externally observed outcomes really are. This paper addresses those issues by proposing an instrument for self- monitoring and analyzing software development team performance. The key goal is that practicing teams can use it even on a daily basis to indicate and steer their own performance excellence. This is supported by certain principal performance analysis guidelines. A prototype implementation of the instrument is demonstrated with some empirical cases. The cases indicate that the instrument can indicate noticeable differences in the perceived performance of individual team members and the team external outcomes. It helps detecting potential performance problems and impediments as well as improving even high- performers, and explaining team performance differences.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>            <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Succeeding with Testing in Agile Teams</h2>      <p>The way developers and testers approach automated testing is qualitatively different in agile teams, and many struggle with practices like TDD and automated functional testing. In this panel discussion, four industry thought leaders discuss their experiences around testing, as teams transition to new and more effective ways of working.

But do they really work, do they make us truly agile where responses to change are quick and effortless? In many cases the bottleneck is the architecture, design and general quality of the code base. What is the relationship between design and agility? What are the business consequences of an agile code base? And how do we know if we are moving in the right direction? In this workshop we will pose some provocative questions, propose a few possible approaches and together discuss how they measure up to real world experience.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>       <h3 class="subtitle-sessions-bis">16:30 - 17:00</h3>    <p class="pause">Break</p>    <h3 class="subtitle-sessions">17:00 - 18:00</h3>       <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Keynote: Dave Snowden</h2>     <p>ABSTRACT</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>           <h3 class="subtitle-sessions-bis">19:00</h3>    <p class="pause">Social Activity TBA</p>        <h2 id="day-3" class="title-sessions-bis">Wednesday, 23 May 2012</h2> <h3 class="subtitle-sessions">7:00</h3>        <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>5km Run</h2>     <h3>5km Run Organizers: Emily Bache, Tobias Anderberg</h3>  <p>Just for fun, conference delegates are welcome to gather for an early morning 5km run along the seafront.

Moreno and Agustín Yagüe (Short Paper, 20 minutes)</h3><p>Usability is a critical quality factor. Therefore, like traditional software teams, agile teams have to address usability to properly catch their users experience. There exists an interesting debate in the agile and usability communities about how to achieve this integration. Our aim is to contribute to this debate by discussing the incorporation of particular usability recommendations into user stories, one of the most popular artifacts for communicating agile requirements. In this paper, we explore the implications of usability for both the structure of and the process for defining user stories. We discuss what changes the incorporation of particular usability issues may introduce in a user story. Although our findings require more empirical validation, we think that they are a good starting point for further research on this line.</p><h3>Evidence-Based Timelines for Agile Project Retrospectives – A Method Proposal Elizabeth Bjarnason and Björn Regnell (Short Paper, 20 minutes)</h3><p>Retrospective analysis of agile projects can support identification of issues through team reflection and may enable learning and process improvements. Basing retrospectives primarily on experiences poses a risk of memory bias as people may remember events differently, which can lead to incorrect conclusions. This bias is enhanced in project retrospectives which cover a longer period compared to iteration retrospectives. To support teams in recalling accurate and joint views of projects, we propose using an evidence-based timeline with historical data as input to project retrospectives. The proposed method was developed together with a large software development company in the telecommunications domain. This paper outlines a method for visualizing an evidence-based project timeline by illustrating aspects such as business priority, iterations and test activities. Our method complements an experience-based approach by providing objective data as a starting point for reflection and aims to support objective analysis of issues and root causes.</p><h3>Who is Stronger in your Agile Deployment – The Id or the Superego? Stavros Stavru and Sylvia Ilieva (Short Paper, 20 minutes)</h3><p>Many studies and industrial reports have demonstrated the tendency towards the increasing number of organizations, interested in agile software development. With the transition from intentions to actions, the question that naturally arises is how the deployment process should be approached. In this paper we argue that shared organizational values, which we call organizational Superego, should be the main drivers for the deployment and post-deployment assessment of agile methods and techniques. Along with that we propose a new organizational classification technique, which assesses the power of the Superego to shape organizational behavior, together with an organizational value framework to be used for strengthening it. We further discuss how a strong Superego would approach the deployment of agile methods and techniques, and outline a future agile deployment framework, based on organizational values.</p><h3>adVANTAGE: A Fair Pricing Model for Agile Software Development Contracting Matthias Book, Volker Gruhn and Rüdiger Striemer (Short Paper, 20 minutes)</h3><p>Agile software development methods are harder to adopt by third-party software developers than by in-house software development teams, since traditional contractual frameworks can easily lead to unfair risk distributions between client and supplier when applied to agile projects. We therefore present a pricing model for agile software projects that distributes risks evenly between the partners, and encourages efficient, high-quality contributions on both sides.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>     <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Tech Demos</h2>    <h3>Architecture Without Trying J.B.

Planning Poker is a common technique for sizing user stories, however it has challenges. It can be time consuming and teams can get bogged down in unnecessary discussion. This session describes a technique called Silent Grouping that can be used to complement Planning Poker, explaining how to apply it so that large sets of user stories can be sized in minutes. Silent Grouping has several advantages. It is fast, which in turn leads to significant time and cost savings. It also has more subtle benefits. The technique has been used with large teams to size hundreds of user stories in minutes for Release Planning sessions. This talk demonstrate the technique and show you how to apply it in your teams.</p><h3>Demo TBA (Demo, 30 minutes)</h3>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>     <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Open Space Sessions</h2>    <p>See the Market Place for current sessions.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>      <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>25 Agile Adoption Killers You Must Avoid</h2>    <h3>25 Agile Adoption Killers You Must Avoid Faisal Mahmood (Workshop, 90 minutes)</h3><p>Don't become another failed Agile adoption statistic.

Most organisational change initiatives involve not only newer practices and processes, but a shift in the company's culture. This is particularly the case when introducing agile and lean methodologies for software development. Some of the common approaches to organisational change are training and coaching, with the promise of bringing external knowledge to a company, so that its employees can apply new skills to their work environment. While these approaches certainly have value, we believe that alone they do not bring about sustainable change in an organisations behaviour. This presentation will introduce a hands on approach to learning that not only introduces new practices but has a strong focus on providing sustainable change in the way people work. Originally designed as an internal training program for ThoughtWorks, this model has been running for more than one year with much success at introducing new employees to the culture and practices used within the company. The focus of this approach is to expose participants to real problems. Participants are taught theory and practices which are then applied and reflected upon in a real project. This model, like training, can be effective at providing people with the knowledge they need, however it allows them the opportunity to apply that knowledge to their own work challenges, within their own working environment, over an extended period of time. We're aiming this presentation at managers, trainers, coaches and anyone who is interested in implementing change. We'll introduce you to the model and also share our ideas in how you can apply it for organisational change and learning.</p><h3>Identifying and Eliminating Waste in Complex Product Development Organizations Ken Power (Experience Report, 30 minutes)</h3><p>Product Development can be viewed as a Complex Adaptive System. Different people, groups, organizations and systems collaborate in a complex network of relationships and dependencies to produce something of value - generally a product or service. Identifying waste in this value network is a critical step towards creating a truly lean and agile organization. This session will (1) show how to apply exercises that identify waste, (2) provide a framework for managing waste, and (3) provide some concrete strategies and practices for eliminating waste in your organization.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>          <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Lightning Talks</h2>    <h3>Vision Workshop Bent Jensen (Lightning Talk, 15 minutes)</h3><p>How to create a vivid and attractive product vision in3 hours! One way to do it is to sit down in quiet loneliless and dream up the product vision. A better way is to walk a team through a series of steps that creates a solid background for understanding, envisioning and strategizing the product. This talk describes a workshop, originally developed and used at a large danish insurance company, that in a big push moved the whole IT-organization towards agile development. A part of this transition was to guide newly appointed Product Owners through a visioning process.</p><h3>The Tao of Agile Thinking Fabio Armani (Lightning Talk, 15 minutes)</h3><p>This lighting talk aims to explore, from an holistic point of view as opposed to the reductionist thinking, how the Lean Agile methodologies can be considered as part of the "turning point" in the crisis of Western reductionist way of thinking. Recent scientific discoveries indicate that all life – from the most primitive cells, up to human societies, corporations and nation-states, even the global economy – is organized along the same basic patterns and principles: those of the network. Both (Lean & Agile) offer a thinking tool set that allow us to create new models and different approaches. Hence, in this lighting talk I would like to affirm how tightly humans are connected with the fabric of life and make it clear that it is imperative to organize our world according to a different set of values and beliefs.</p><h3>Layers of Complexity Marcus Ahnve (Lightning Talk, 15 minutes)</h3><p>I have never been in a project with stable velocity.

The development teams are coached to self-organize, improve continuously and work closely with their product owner. Often this leaves the managers confused and frustrated as they are left with the same responsibilities but are expected to exert a lot less authority and influence on their employees. In this lightning talk I will show how I try to create an environment where both managers and employees become empowered.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>                <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>A Shock To The System</h2>    <h3>A Shock To the System Olve Maudal, Ken Power, Moderator: Steven Fraser (Panel, 90 minutes)</h3><p>Once considered as an approach limited to small, co-located teams, agile development has evolved to a culture embraced by large, distributed organizations. The goal is to move beyond agile teams to foster an agile organization. The transition to "agile" may be initiated within legacy-driven organizations - by grassroots teams trialing agile approaches - and evolve to sanctioned pilot projects. In some cases the adoption of agile may be accelerated by the acquisition of an agile company. Cultural shock and reformation may ensue when agile teams begin integration with the behemoth that is represented by the legacy-driven organization. Through a mixture of challenges and successes - best practices evolve. This panel will explore essential ingredients for a success transition – "a shock to the system".</p><p>Note: Additional panelists will be selected from participants in the "Shock to the System" workshop, held on Monday.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>               <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Open Space Sessions</h2>    <p>See the Market Place for current sessions.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>             <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Joining Usability and Agile: Before or After?</h2>    <h3>Joining Usability and Agile: Before or After? Ana Moreno & Agustín Yague (Workshop, 90 minutes)</h3><p>There is no agreement in the community about when to deal with usability and UX during the agile process. Two possible alternatives come out, a proactive vs. a reactive approach. In the proactive approach product owner, developers and usability experts, if any, discuss which usability practices should be interesting either at the beginning of the agile process or the iterations, while a reactive approach might wait for the corresponding usability needs to emerge from the user and would be considered in future iterations. This session's aim is to discuss about the pros and cons of these aproximations as well as other that could combine both alternatives.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>                       <h3 class="subtitle-sessions-bis">14:30 - 15:00</h3>   <p class="pause">Break</p>        <h3 class="subtitle-sessions">15:00 - 16:30</h3>    <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Experience Reports</h2><h3>Surprise Speaker TBA (Talk, 30 minutes)</h3><p>ABSTRACT</p><h3>Large Scale Continuous Integration Lars-Ola Damm (Talk, 60 minutes)</h3><p>The business unit 'Support solutions' within Ericsson has been implementing agile and as a part of this continuous integration since 2007. When implementing continuous integration in the smaller products (~20-50 developers/product) this was a challenge that could be managed with iterative investments during 1-2 years. For example, in the first product I was part of implementing this is in, we after 6 months improvement work knew within minutes if we had broken any legacy and were able to deliver working software every day.</p><p>But when scaling this to larger products, things started getting more complicated. What do you do when it's not enough to add more servers to speed up the build loops? How do you implement continuous integration in a product where you have huge amounts of legacy code and legacy tests that needs to be maintained for a very large installed customer base? This at the same time as having a constant market pressure to not decrease the throughput while investing in such improvements. This talk will present results and experiences from the implementations described above. This includes describing how the test execution time was brought down, e.g. by restructuring test suites and implementing cloud-based build environments. The presentation will also include ongoing work to shorten the feedback loops even further through test avoidance, i.e. by applying test selection algorithms that dynamically determines which test cases that need to be re-executed after each code change. Finally, the presentation will touch upon how the concept of "continuous delivery" can be applied in a large-scale environment, e.g. the largest of the products mentioned above provide the latest version of the software to the market once every 6 weeks.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>               <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Release and Maintenance</h2><h3>Session Chair: Torgeir Dingsøyr, SINTEF ICT, Norway</h3><h3>Release Readiness Indicator for Mature Agile and Lean Software Development Projects Miroslaw Staron, Wilhelm Meding and Klas Palm (Research Paper, 30 minutes)</h3><p>Large companies like Ericsson increasingly often adopt the principles of Agile and Lean software development and develop large software products in iterative manner – in order to quickly respond to customer needs. In this paper we present the main indicator which is sufficient for a mature software development organization in order to predict the time in weeks to release the product. In our research project we collaborated closely with a large Agile+Lean software development project at Ericsson in Sweden. This large and mature software development project and organization has found this main indicator – release readiness – to be so important that it was used as a key performance indicator and is used in controlling the development of the product and improving organizational performance. The indicator was developed and validated in an action research project at one of the units of Ericsson AB in Sweden in one of its largest projects.</p><h3>A Palette of Lean Indicators to Detect Waste in Software Maintenance: A Case Study Kai Petersen (Research Paper, 30 minutes)</h3><p>Software maintenance is a key activity in software development requiring considerable effort and time. Hence, it is important to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the maintenance process. The objective of this article is to introduce a palette of indicators to assess the maintenance process based on indicators lean indicators. Four indicators aiming at detecting waste have been proposed, namely the inflow of maintenance requests, the flow of maintenance requests through the maintenance process with regard to continuous value creation and high throughput, the analysis of lead-times, and the analysis of workload. The research method is case study in which the proposed indicators were applied on the maintenance process of one case company (Ericsson AB).</p><h3>A Comparative Study of Scrum and Kanban Approaches on a Real Case Study Using Simulation David J. Anderson, Giulio Concas, Maria Ilaria Lunesu, Michele Marchesi and Hongyu Zhang (Research Paper, 30 minutes)</h3><p>We present the application of software process modeling and simulation using an agent-based approach to a real case study of software maintenance. The original process used PSP/TSP; it spent a large amount of time estimating in advance maintenance requests, and needed to be greatly improved. To this purpose, a Kanban system was successfully implemented, that demonstrated to be able to substantially improve the process without giving up PSP/TSP. We customized the simulator and, using input data with the same characteristics of the real ones, we were able to obtain results very similar to that of the processes of the case study, in particular of the original process. We also simulated, using the same input data, the possible application of the Scrum process to the same data, showing results comparable to the Kanban process.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>              <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>A Change Model for Agile Transformations</h2><h3>A Change Model for Agile Transformations Diana Larsen and Jutta Eckstein (Workshop, 90 minutes)</h3><p>When an organization makes a real effort to be Agile, they set in motion a series of changes that ripple throughout the entire organization. The side-effects are often surprising, and dealing with them can be challenging.</p><p>At the Agile Alliance's "Supporting Agile Adoption" workshop in December 2011, Jutta Eckstein, Diana Larsen, and James Shore tackled this problem with a new change model targeted at Agile transformations.

Everything just works, things you have only dreamed of comes out of your collaboration and it is the coolest thing you have ever experienced. Then again, there were also these other situations where it just felt awkward, nothing worked and it felt like you were working solo but sat together. Much like trying to work on public transportation. Noisy, unpredictable and quite a bumpy ride.During the course of a day, or a whole project many tasks needs completion and how you interact with others have a big effect on both the result and on how you get there. Some people pair up on difficult tasks, some prefer to prototype alone to validate something while others have conversations. In short, different situations call for different modes of interaction as well as different types of activities. By being able to quickly switch between the different modes, a team as a whole will become much more effective.</p><p>We will present a simple model over these modes of action and interaction. To switch modes effectively we use what we call gestures and responses as positive catalysts. During the session, which will be highly practical, you will practice using such gestures and responses.Does this sound weird?

Our community presents business organizations with the choice between adopting (and hopefully adapting) a set of rules for joining the world of Agile development on the one hand and remaining with the traditional *waterfall* approach on the other. Studies show that traditional project managers are increasingly receptive to reducing the “waterfall” with concepts borrowed from Agile, in fact you can totally remove the waterfall and not be agile.

("Här är ditt kylskåp") as a metaphor(!) for how to innovate and to deliver a great product on time, in a very small timebox, utilizing whatever is available adding generous amount of engineering skill, insightfulness and creativity to make it on time every time.</p><p>The early 1990s TV-show starred Jan Boris-Möller, an electrical engineer turned chef, who showed up at the home of a person of some public recognition. The celebrity had been told that they would get interviewed by a TV-host. They did not know that at the same time Jan would go through their fridge and cupboards to create, in their very own kitchen with whatever was available, an original three course meal in just a few hours. Jan basically just showed up with some sharp knives and did everything on the spot, delivering every time in front of running TV cameras.We are very proud to have an agile inspiration to so many of us early Agile/XP-ers in Sweden, Jan Boris-Möller, creating our conference dinner. Jan will also give a talk during the day about how Agile Development compares to what happens in a great kitchen.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>              <h2 id="day-4" class="title-sessions-bis">Thursday, 24 May 2012</h2><h3 class="subtitle-sessions-bis">9:00-10:00</h3><div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Specific Agile Practices</h2><h3>Session Chair: Maria Paasivaara, Aalto University, Finland</h3><h3>Impact of Test Design Technique Knowledge on Test Driven Development: A Controlled Experiment Adnan Causevic, Daniel Sundmark and Sasikumar Punnekkat (Research Paper, 30 minutes)</h3><p>Agile development approaches are increasingly being followed and favored by the industry. Test Driven Development (TDD) is a key agile practice and recent research results suggest that the successful adoption of TDD depends on different limiting factors, one of them being insufficient developer testing skills. The goal of this paper is to investigate if developers who are educated on general testing knowledge will be able to utilize TDD more effectively. We conducted a controlled experiment with master students during the course on Software Verification &amp; Validation (V&amp;V) where source code and test cases created by each participant during the labs as well as their answers on a survey questionnaire were collected and analyzed. Descriptive statistics indicate improvements in statement coverage. However, no statistically significant differences could be established between the pre- and post-course groups of students. By qualitative analysis of students' tests, we noticed a lack of test cases for non-stated requirements ("negative" tests) resulting in a non-detection of bugs. Students did show preference towards TDD in surveys. Although further research is required to fully establish this, we believe that identifying specific testing knowledge which is complementary to the testing skills of a new TDD developer would enable developers to perform their tasks in a more efficient manner.</p><h3>Escalation of Committment: A Longitudinal Case Study of Daily Meetings Viktoria Gulliksen Stray, Nils Brede Moe and Tore Dybå (Research Paper, 30 minutes)</h3><p>Escalating commitment is a common and costly phenomenon in software projects in which decision-makers continue to invest resources to a failing course of action. We conducted a longitudinal case study exploring the effect of daily meetings on escalating commitment. This was done in an agile project building software for the oil and gas industry. By analyzing data collected over a period of four years, and drawing on concepts from self-justification theory we found that daily meetings contributed to maintain a situation of escalating commitment. This especially occurs if the meeting becomes a place for reporting and defending decisions with team members feeling that they have to justify their choices towards the project management or fellow team members. Early signs of escalation such as rationalizing continuation of a chosen course of action must therefore be taken seriously.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>   <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Agile Contracts - Faults, Errors and Possibilities</h2>   <h3>Agile Contracts - Faults, Errors and Possibilities Lars Ahrred (Talk, 1 hour)</h3> <p>Lindahl is one of the largest corporate law firms in Sweden with a marked focus on advisory services to knowledge oriented, innovative and technology intensive companies. Attorney Lars Arrhed in the Gothenburg office has during the last years worked with direction towards new forms of cooperation for project management within both the contract area and the IT sector.

The development teams are coached to self-organize, improve continuously and work closely with their product owner. Often this leaves the managers confused and frustrated as they are left with the same responsibilities but are expected to exert a lot less authority and influence on their employees. In this lightning talk I will show how I try to create an environment where both managers and employees become empowered.</p><h3>The "Good Girl" Syndrome Andreas Larsson (Lightning Talk, 15 minutes)</h3><p>"Good girl" syndrome makes people take all feedback as personal. Negative feedback becomes devastating for our self esteem, and we try our best to avoid it. How does this affect an organization where learning is key? We know that learning requires a fair amount of failing. So how much failure can we stand?In order to create a true learning organization we need to get rid of the good girl syndrome! In this talk we mix theory with experience to explore some techniques that will help us separate feedback on results and on behaviour.</p><h3>The Opposite of Agile Is Not Waterfall Steve Holyer (Lightning Talk, 15 minutes)</h3><p>Find a description of Agile development that doesn't mention the "waterfall" nature of the the software development lifecycle. It's hard to do. Our community presents business organizations with the choice between adopting (and hopefully adapting) a set of rules for joining the world of Agile development on the one hand and remaining with the traditional *waterfall* approach on the other. Studies show that traditional project managers are increasingly receptive to reducing the "waterfall" with concepts borrowed from Agile, in fact you can totally remove the waterfall and not be agile.

As time went on, many frameworks added parameterized (aka data-driven) tests, where the test arguments could be supplied externally. Theories, as implemented in JUnit and NUnit are the next evolutionary step, combining external data sourcing with internal validation of the data to select only those test cases that are relevant to what we are seeking to test. While parameterized tests are generally little more than a notational convenience, Theories amount to a new way of looking at tests.</p><p>This demo will start with a single test and then expand it to a set of parameterized test cases using several different approaches. Finally, we'll create several Theories that capture and extend the notions in the earlier tests. Examples will be shown in both Java/JUnit and C#/NUnit and will illustrate ways of using the Theory concept as a part of your toolkit.</p><h3>StoryText : Agile GUI testing by Behaviour Change Management Geoffrey Bache (Demo, 30 minutes)</h3><p>The GUI is usually the most volatile part of an application, so if your automated tests rely on it, they are often fragile. The usual advice is therefore to prefer tests that use a more stable API just under the GUI layer. That is not always a useful approach - the application I'm testing at present has a very complex GUI, and it's important that it works, as well as the code underneath. StoryText lets me test through the GUI, and has several features that allow me to manage the fact that the GUI is volatile.</p><p>In this demo, I'll show how StoryText works on a simple GUI application, and explain how we're using it to test an enterprise system for planning and optimizing airline crew rosters.</p><p>A test with StoryText has two parts. The ﬁrst part is a description of what the user does: a series of action steps written in a domain-language. The second part is the "story" of what the GUI does in response - a plain-text version of what happens on the screen. You can sketch out both parts of the test before the UI even exists - for example when doing BDD or ATDD. The test is reﬁned and made executable once the GUI is built - a little like adding "step deﬁnitions" in Cucumber or "ﬁxtures" for Fitnesse. If you're writing tests for an existing GUI - for example when retroﬁtting regression tests to an existing application - you can record both parts of the test directly in this domain language.</p><p>StoryText aims to tell the "story" of what happens in the GUI, by generating a plain-text description of (in broad strokes) how it looks and how it changes over time. You keep a "golden copy" of how the GUI should look, and if it changes, you may have found a regression bug, or just that the GUI has been improved in some visible way. It's then easy to update the golden copies for many tests in bulk, or ﬁlter the output to ignore parts you don't want to assert on.StoryText was previously called "PyUseCase" is an open source tool, currently used to test applications written using SWT/Eclipse Rich Client Platform and Swing on the JVM, and PyGTK, Tkinter and wxPython for Python.</p><h3>Configuration as Code - Chef and Puppet Marcus Ahnve (Demo, 30 minutes)</h3><p>Configuration as code using devops tools like Puppet and Chef allows for a stable, predictable and automated server setup and configuration process.

Large scale coding contests with hundreds of participants provide an opportunity to observe the participants -– how they approach on solving the problem as well as their solution. These contests provide a lot of data points like various participants backgrounds, different experience levels, individuals and teams, etc. This workshop shall bring researchers and practitioners together to brainstorm possible experiments and how to set them up in the context of coding contests. The outcome shall be to increase the amount of usable data for empirical studies by using programming contests as experiments. We encourage agile researchers to present a case study or experience report of an experiment as well as practitioners and researchers without specific experience to participate at the workshop.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>           <h3 class="subtitle-sessions-bis">12:00-13:00</h3>  <p class="pause">Lunch</p> <h3 class="subtitle-sessions">13:00-14:00</h3>   <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Agile Where It Shouldn't Work</h2>   <h3>Agile Where It Shouldn't Work Nancy Van Schooenderwoert</h3><p>Some systems are simply too big, too monolithic to be delivered in small increments by small teams – right? You couldn't upgrade an oil refinery's controls incrementally, or redeploy a bank's computing infrastructure in 2-week segments. Some endeavors are too risky and too inherently monolithic for that. So they say. This is the wilderness; the Everest that Agile hasn't scaled, yet traditional development methods are failing here.</p><p>Early leaders in the Agile movement were careful to restrict their claims of improvements: "XP is a light-weight methodology for small-to-medium-sized teams developing software in the face of vague or rapidly changing requirements."1 But a lot has happened since 2000 and real teams are scaling those peaks – and keeping their methodology light-weight.

With TDD, programmers get instant feedback that their code does what they intend. Rumor has it that TDD cannot be used for developing C, let alone embedded C. The rumor is wrong! TDD can be used effectively for all forms of C. In this tutorial attendees get first-hand experience at TDD, writing well tested code in the challenging world of C. Attendees see how to break dependencies on the target execution environment enabling embedded code to be effectively test-driven. You will see how TDD helps to prevent many bugs and memory leaks from ever making the bug list. We'll use CppUTest, an open source test harness, is used to collect, organize and automate C++ unit tests.</p><p>Many of the challenges in embedded development stem from the target hardware bottleneck. The bottleneck slows progress of the embedded software due to non-existent or buggy hardware, and the inefficiencies of cross-platform development. The tutorial shows how to effectively use TDD and object oriented design techniques to overcome the target hardware bottleneck.</p><p>Bring your laptop or pair with one of the other attendees. We'll help you get ready at the tutorial, but it would be best if you did some setup before. Please register at www.renaissancesofteware.net using course code XP2012. You will find computer and setup instructions under Resources in Conference Attendee Extras.Audience: This tutorial is designed for embedded software developers, technical leaders, software architects, firmware developers.

In this session, we discuss these challenges; present a case study, Intuit's Quickbooks productline that combined agile software development, design thinking and self-organizing teams in a successful approach; and discuss a generalized approachand implications from employing the techniques in your organization.</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>            <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Beheading the Legacy Beast</h2>    <h3>Beheading the Legacy Beast Daniel Brolund and Ola Ellnestam (Workshop, 3 hours)</h3><p>Eventually, a code base must change, but just steaming ahead making changes that break the code and then fixing errors often leads to creating more errors! It's like a fight with the Software Hydra - for every scary head cut off, two more grow out! Instead, come to this workshop to learn The Mikado Method, a systematic approach to beat the Hydra and change your code in a safe way.</p><p>The method helps visualize, prepare and perform business-value-focused changes while delivering continuously, without having a broken code-base in the process. It enhances team communication, collaboration and learning, and helps individuals stay on track.This is a BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop) workshop with hands on coding. The exercises will be mainly in Java, with the first smaller exercise also available in C#. Participants can also bring their own troubled code to work on in the second half of the workshop.</p>   <p><a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a></p>   </div>      <h3 class="subtitle-sessions-bis">12:00-13:00</h3> <p class="pause">Lunch</p><h3 class="subtitle-sessions">13:00-17:00</h3>   <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Hardware Kanban Game</h2>   <h3>Hardware Kanban Game Nancy Van Schooenderwoert (Tutorial, 3 hours)</h3><p>Hardware development work has a physical aspect that makes controlling the flow especially difficult, such as deep specializations, and having outside vendors build custom components. This extension of the "getKanban" game models the hardware development workflow. As a player, you can change task priorities, expedite key items, or help other departments, but you must obey the WIP limits!</p><p>You'll see how these rules drive behaviors that you never would have expected by analysis alone. The game lets you live the action and make the decisions. Participants track daily progress along each workstream using a Control Chart, a Cumulative Flow Diagram, and Financial Summary chart. The effect of your choices such as increase queue sizes, reduce work-in-progress limits, expedite certain work – are seen graphically in the charts. This is a very engaging way to experience core lean ideas.</p>      <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>        <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Wolf Pack Programming</h2>   <h3>Wolf Pack Programming Jason Ayers (Workshop, 3 hours)</h3><p>The problem with Continuous Integration is that you still have to integrate. Pair Programming is also constrained: You can't have more than two, you can't have fewer than two, and actually you don't quite have two. Maybe we can do better.</p><p>Using a dynamic language, it is possible to create an environment where we are no longer limited by the number of people who can comfortably fitaround a single workstation. An entire team of programmers can collaboratesimultaneously on the same live code base; they never need to integrate because they always are. In this hands-on workshop, we will borrow from the hunting strategies of wolves to take Extreme Programming practices and turn them all the way up to 11.</p><p>To facilitate the exercise, we will use a web-based development environment. The focus of the workshop, however, is not on the technology but rather on the benefits and challenges of real-time collaboration. Does this practice make conventional Agile approaches look cumbersome or does it lead to disaster? To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we will ask our wolf packs to complete a series of tasks following the process.</p><p>This is a hands-on session; every participant should bring a laptop!</p>   <a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>         <div data-role="collapsible">   <h2>Agile Cafe</h2>    <h3>Come to the Agile Cafe!</h3><p>Waiting for a workshop or tutorial to begin?

Rainsberger</h2><p>Integrated tests are a scam: a self-replicating virus that threatens your code base, your sanity, your life! Your unit tests pass 100%, but you still have bugs, so you write integrated tests to make sure that things work together correctly… this way leads to pain and suffering. You need clearer interactions between objects, and more big tests make that problem *worse*, not better! In this session you'll learn the master design technique that can help you have arbitrarily high confidence in the correctness of your objects while testing 99.9% of your system with fast, tiny, crystal clear tests.</p><a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a>   </div>      <div data-role="collapsible"><h2>Liftoff! Launching Agile Teams and Projects</h2><h3>Liftoff! Launching Agile Teams and Projects Diana Larsen (Tutorial, 3 hours)</h3><p>Liftoff - it's the unexplored, often ignored, Agile software development project practice. Liftoff gives impetus to your projects in a way that starts the project team, and the business, on the trajectory to success. Project sponsors, product managers, and product owners use these critical meetings to inform, inspire, and align the people who do the work with the definition of the work to be done.</p><p>As the first act of the flight, a rocket launch requires an entire set of systems to successfully lift the vehicle into orbit - not just the vehicle itself, but all the systems needed for smoothly moving off the ground into space. Likewise, your project needs its entire set of supporting systems in place to begin a successful journey to high performance, hyper-productivity, and high value delivery.</p><p>In this talk, Diana Larsen explores ways to accomplish Liftoff, including the vital step of chartering the project. She'll share real-life stories of how others have effectively started their projects; a varietyof team activities to fuel your Liftoff; and a framework for effective, "just enough" Agile chartering.</p>   <p class="add-last"><a href="#" class="add" title="Add this">Add to favourite</a></p>   </div>                  </div>                 <div data-role="footer" data-position="fixed">        <ul id="list-footer">        <li><a href="bites.html" class="bites-drinks">Bites & Drinks</a></li>        <li><a href="socials.html" class="socials">Socials</a></li>        <li><a href="info.html" class="info">Info</a></li>        <li><a href="settings.html" class="settings">Settings</a></li>        </ul>    </div></div><!-- Grab Google CDN's jQuery, with a protocol relative URL; fall back to local if offline --><script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="js/libs/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"><\/script>')</script><!-- Grab Google CDN's jQuery, with a protocol relative URL; fall back to local if offline --><script src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0rc1/jquery.mobile-1.0rc1.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery.mobile || document.write('<script src="js/libs/jquery.mobile-1.0rc1.min.js"><\/script>')</script><!-- scripts  script --><script src="js/plugins.js"></script><script src="js/sessions.js"></script></body></html>
